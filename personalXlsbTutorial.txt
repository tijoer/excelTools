Create a new Excel file.

Go to view->macros->record new macro  (or something like this. I don't have an english excel version)
Record an empty macro to your personal.xlsb.
Save and exit 

Excel will now have created a new file called PERSONAL.XLSB in C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART

You can store your personal modules there.
